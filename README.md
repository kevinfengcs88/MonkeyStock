# MonkeyStock
MonkeyStock is a two-stage application that assesses the sentiment that Twitter users have on stocks and subsequently buys and sells stock accordingly. The first stage generates a model based on Twitter users' sentiment on stocks and the second stage integrates the information from the first stage to optimize stock trading.

## Inspiration
MonkeyStock was inspired by the titular primate, "Monkey," and the popular company ownership mode of trading, "Stock."

## What it does
MonkeyStock creates a model from Twitter users' sentiment about stocks and then interprets information from the model to buy and sell stocks.

## How we built it
To build MonkeyStock, we first set up a Live Share session in Visual Studio Code so we could have a live, collaborative environment to add files and code to. We researched the necessary packages and tools for creating a model based on Twitter users' sentiments and then became monkeys. The rest is self-explanatory.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Stringifying the data during data preprocessing
2. Getting the stock list just as symbols through the IEX website
3. Scraping tweets and storing them as .csv files compatible with the developed training model

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Successfully implementing the aforementioned challenges we ran into

## What we learned
Monkeys are incredibly proficient at trading stocks. Humans are incredibly inefficient at writing code.

## What's next for MonkeyStock
Next, we will integrate real-life monkeys that buy and sell stock. Apes such as chimpanzees and gorillas will also be accepted. We are a non-discriminatory organization.
